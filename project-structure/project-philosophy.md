description: The guiding principles behind our projects
---

We structure the code and documentation with "development first" principle. Such as,

* All default configuration is for development environment (dev mode).
* All project repositories have development mock data in their repository.
* In dev mode, development database is populated in first run and doesn't reset or deleted on application restart.

"Development first" principle is not limited with above items. We always design and do things to make the next 
developers' lives easier.
