* Use the current purchased theme in <a href="https://kodgemisi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/70471916/UI+Templates+Themes" target="_blank">this page</a>.
* Generate favicons from <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net" target="_blank">https://realfavicongenerator.net</a>.
* Make sure there is no horizontal scroll in desktop, tablet and mobile view of an application.
* When there is not enough content on a page to push the footer, the footer should still be at the bottom of the page.
* Make sure there is no typo and grammatical mistake on any page.
* Every application UI has current version of the application in the main page. It may be visible or hidden but it is located in HTML.
  - Preferably in footer.
  - Preferably in every page.
