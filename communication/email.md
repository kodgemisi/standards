description: Rules that every Kod Gemisi crew should remember when using email
---

These rules and conventions are considered universal and you should also follow them using email outside Kod Gemisi domain.

* **When sending to an email list, absolutely make sure that everybody in that group are interested about what you've just write.**
* **Don't be chatty when one of the recipients in TO or CC is an email list.**
* When replying to an email, keep recipients in CC unless you have a specific reason to remove them from the conversation.
  - You can do this by default by using `reply to all` option.
* If you are certain that a person is already in a email list, remove his/her address from TO and CC. (optional)
  - For example you get an email from Joe Doe and in CC there is John Doe and acme-dev-list@example.com list. Let's say you need to forward the mail to human resources. Also you know that John Doe is in hr@example.com list. In that case when you sending the email you can remove John from CC. It should look like this: TO: hr@example.com CC: joe.doe@example.com, acme-dev-list@example.com
  - For example you know that John Doe is in acme-dev-list@example.com list. If there is a mail from John and you hit reply-all you may have John's address in TO and the list's address in CC. In this case you shouldn't remove John's address from TO because you are directly replying to John. You shouldn't remove the list's address from CC because you also want everybody in the list to hear about what you write to John.
* When you are writing about a leave, late arrival, financial issue or a social or work place problem you should either send the email directly to hr<i class="at-sign"></i>kodgemisi.com.
* When anybody outside Kod Gemisi and not our customer asks you about a communication email for the company (other than yours) you should give selam<i class="at-sign"></i>kodgemisi.com.
* If you need to forward an email to management you should send it to idari<i class="at-sign"></i>kodgemisi.com.
