title: Messaging rules
description: Communication rules when using any instant messaging application like Slack, Telegram or WhatsApp
---

* Be more polite than you are usually in a verbal chat as it is easier to misinterpret something in written communication.
* Don't send `Kod Gemisi Tayfa` groups in instant messaging applications illegal, offensive or racist material.
* Don't get into an personal argument in messaging groups or channels.
* Remember that nothing is official in any instant chat application, including but not limited to: announcements, approvals and desicions.
  - Note that having a channel using Kod Gemisi logo or other branding material doesn't make it official.
  - Note that a manager saying something over an instant messaging app still doesn't make it official.
