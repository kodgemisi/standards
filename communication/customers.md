* Don't give time or cost estimates to customers even you are directly asked.
* Don't communicate with customers over an instant messaging app. If you had to and the conversation includes a decision
want an email about it. Don't implement the desicion without an email. Immediately inform your team leader if you cannot get an email for any reason.
* Don't call customers or send them any message (including email) out of working hours unless you are officially working overtime or officially on night-shift.
